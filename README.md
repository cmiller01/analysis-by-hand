# Analysis by hand
Implementation of some common data analysis methods without the benefit of really nice methods/packages, like `lm` in `R` or `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` in Python.

Everything should be as basic as possible, albeit without reinventing sorting, transposing matricies, etc.

Favoring simplicity over efficiency.

# Requirements
This project is using `R` and `python` as the main engines for analysis; you will need one or both to run the tests.

* `R`
  * Install R from here: http://cran.org
  * Recommend RStudio too: http://rstudio.com
  * Required packages, install with `install.packages('package_name')` from R console
    * testthat
* `Python`
  * Install Python 3

# Testing
These methods should return same values as the "built-in" methods and that is testable.

To run all the tests for R use:

To run all the test for Python use:

# Methods

## T-test

## Correlation Coefficient

## ANOVA

## Linear Regression

## Principal Component Analysis

## K-means
