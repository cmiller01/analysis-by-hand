# Analysis by hand
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cmiller01/analysis-by-hand.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cmiller01/analysis-by-hand)

Implementation of some common data analysis methods without the benefit of really nice methods/packages, like `lm` in `R` or `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` in Python.

Everything should be as basic as possible, albeit without reinventing sorting, transposing matricies, etc.

Favoring simplicity over efficiency.
